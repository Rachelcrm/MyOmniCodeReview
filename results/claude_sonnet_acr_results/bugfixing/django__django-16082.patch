  "patch": "Looking at the issue, I need to understand what's happening with the MOD operator and output field resolution.\n\nFrom the issue description, the problem is that when using the MOD operator with different numeric types (Decimal and Integer), Django doesn't properly resolve the output field to a Decimal type like it does for other mathematical operators.\n\nLooking at the code locations provided, I can see that:\n\n1. Location #7 shows the `CombinedExpression` class's `_resolve_output_field` method, which uses `_resolve_combined_type` to handle type resolution for mathematical operators.\n\n2. The intended behavior mentions that I need to add a `_resolve_output_field()` method to the `Mod` class that calls `resolve_output_field(lhs_field, rhs_field)`.\n\nFirst, I need to find where the `Mod` class is defined and understand how other mathematical operators handle this. Looking at the code, I can see that `CombinedExpression` is used for mathematical operations, and it has a proper `_resolve_output_field` method that uses `_resolve_combined_type`.\n\nThe issue is likely that the `Mod` class doesn't have its own `_resolve_output_field` method and falls back to the base class implementation, which doesn't handle mixed types properly.\n\nLet me look for the `Mod` class definition and the `resolve_output_field` function that's mentioned in the intended behavior.\n\nFrom the context, it seems like I need to:\n1. Find the `Mod` class definition\n2. Add a `_resolve_output_field` method that uses the existing `resolve_output_field` function\n3. This should make MOD consistent with other mathematical operators\n\nLet me examine the file to find the `Mod` class and the `resolve_output_field` function.\n\n```\n<file>django/db/models/expressions.py</file>\n<original>\nclass Mod(CombinedExpression):\n    \"\"\"\n    An expression representing the modulo operation.\n    \"\"\"\n\n    def __init__(self, lhs, rhs, output_field=None):\n        super().__init__(lhs, \"%\", rhs, output_field)\n</original>\n<patched>\nclass Mod(CombinedExpression):\n    \"\"\"\n    An expression representing the modulo operation.\n    \"\"\"\n\n    def __init__(self, lhs, rhs, output_field=None):\n        super().__init__(lhs, \"%\", rhs, output_field)\n\n    def _resolve_output_field(self):\n        return resolve_output_field(\n            self.lhs._output_field_or_none, self.rhs._output_field_or_none\n        )\n</patched>\n```"
