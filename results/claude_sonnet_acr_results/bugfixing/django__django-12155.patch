  "patch": "Looking at the issue, the problem is in the `trim_docstring` function in `django/contrib/admindocs/utils.py`. The issue occurs when calculating the minimum indentation level for docstrings.\n\n## Reasoning\n\nThe current code calculates the minimum indentation by considering all non-empty lines in the docstring:\n\n```python\nindent = min(len(line) - len(line.lstrip()) for line in lines if line.lstrip())\n```\n\nHowever, according to PEP 257 (Python docstring conventions), the first line of a docstring should be treated specially. When a docstring starts on the same line as the triple quotes (like `\"\"\"test tests something.`), the first line has zero indentation by definition, which incorrectly affects the minimum indentation calculation.\n\nThe solution is to exclude the first line when calculating the minimum indentation, as suggested in the issue description. This follows PEP 257 guidelines where the first line is handled separately from the rest of the docstring body.\n\nThe fix changes line 37 to skip the first line (`lines[1:]`) when calculating the minimum indentation:\n\n```python\nindent = min(len(line) - len(line.lstrip()) for line in lines[1:] if line.lstrip())\n```\n\nHowever, we also need to handle the edge case where there might be only one line or no indented lines after the first line. In such cases, we should default to an indent of 0.\n\n## Patch\n\n```\n<file>django/contrib/admindocs/utils.py</file>\n<original>\n    indent = min(len(line) - len(line.lstrip()) for line in lines if line.lstrip())\n</original>\n<patched>\n    indent = min((len(line) - len(line.lstrip()) for line in lines[1:] if line.lstrip()), default=0)\n</patched>\n```"
