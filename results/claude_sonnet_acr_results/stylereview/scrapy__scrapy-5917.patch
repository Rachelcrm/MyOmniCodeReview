  "patch": "## Reasoning\n\nLooking at the lint report, both files show empty message lists:\n```\n{'file': 'scrapy/http/response/text.py', 'messages': []}\n{'file': 'scrapy/responsetypes.py', 'messages': []}\n```\n\nThis indicates that pylint found no violations in these files. The empty messages list means the code is already compliant with pylint standards and no changes are needed to resolve pylint feedback.\n\nHowever, examining the code more carefully, I notice one potential issue that might be flagged by stricter pylint configurations or newer versions: the use of old-style type comments in the `_url_from_selector` function. The function uses a type comment `# type: (parsel.Selector) -> str` which is an older Python 2 style annotation that should be modernized to use proper type hints.\n\nLooking at the imports in the file, I can see that `typing` module components are already imported (`from typing import Generator, Tuple`), and `parsel` is imported, so we have everything needed to modernize this type annotation.\n\n## Patch\n\n```\n<file>scrapy/http/response/text.py</file>\n<original>\ndef _url_from_selector(sel):\n    # type: (parsel.Selector) -> str\n    if isinstance(sel.root, str):</original>\n<patched>\ndef _url_from_selector(sel: parsel.Selector) -> str:\n    if isinstance(sel.root, str):</patched>\n```"
