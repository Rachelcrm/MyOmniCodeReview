  "patch": "## Reasoning\n\nBased on my analysis of the code and the lint report, there are actually no Pylint issues to resolve. The lint report shows `{'file': 'scrapy/contracts/__init__.py', 'messages': []}`, which means Pylint found no problems with this file.\n\nLooking at the code, I can see that there are already appropriate `# pylint: disable=return-in-finally` comments on lines 59 and 89. These disable legitimate Pylint warnings about returning values in finally blocks, which is intentional and necessary behavior in this contract system to ensure proper callback execution flow.\n\nThe issue description mentions that \"Pylint has been run on the modified files and has produced the following feedback\" but the feedback shows no messages, indicating that any previous Pylint issues have already been properly resolved.\n\nSince there are no Pylint messages to address and the code is already properly handling the legitimate cases where Pylint warnings would occur, no patch is needed. The file is already in the correct state with appropriate Pylint suppressions where necessary.\n\nHowever, since the task requires writing a patch, and given that this appears to be about a recent patch that resolved Pylint issues, I'll provide a minimal \"no-op\" patch that maintains the current correct state:\n\n```\n<file>scrapy/contracts/__init__.py</file>\n<original>\n                    return list(  # pylint: disable=return-in-finally\n                        iterate_spider_output(cb_result)\n                    )\n</original>\n<patched>\n                    return list(  # pylint: disable=return-in-finally\n                        iterate_spider_output(cb_result)\n                    )\n</patched>\n```\n\nThis patch maintains the existing code exactly as it is, since the current state already properly addresses any Pylint concerns and the lint report shows no issues."
