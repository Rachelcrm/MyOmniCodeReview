  "patch": "Looking at the lint report, there's a Pylint warning about an unused argument 'kwargs' in the `update_level_tags` function at line 8 of `django/contrib/messages/apps.py`. However, the code snippet provided only shows lines 1-7 and doesn't include the `update_level_tags` function.\n\nBased on the intended behavior description, this appears to be a signal handler function that needs to accept `**kwargs` for forward compatibility with Django's signal system, but the parameter is currently unused and causing a Pylint warning.\n\nThe standard Django convention for handling this situation is to rename the unused parameter to indicate it's intentionally unused by prefixing it with an underscore. For keyword arguments, this would be `**_kwargs` instead of `**kwargs`.\n\nSince the provided code snippet doesn't show the actual `update_level_tags` function, I need to infer its location and structure. Given that it's mentioned at line 8 and the provided code ends at line 7, the function must be defined after the class definition.\n\nLet me write a patch that addresses this issue:\n\n```\n<file>django/contrib/messages/apps.py</file>\n<original>\ndef update_level_tags(sender, **kwargs):\n</original>\n<patched>\ndef update_level_tags(sender, **_kwargs):\n</patched>\n```\n\nThe reasoning behind this change:\n1. The function is likely a Django signal handler that needs to accept `**kwargs` for compatibility with the signal system\n2. By renaming `kwargs` to `_kwargs`, we indicate that the parameter is intentionally unused\n3. This follows Django's convention and suppresses the Pylint warning while maintaining the exact same functionality\n4. The underscore prefix is a Python convention for indicating unused variables/parameters"
