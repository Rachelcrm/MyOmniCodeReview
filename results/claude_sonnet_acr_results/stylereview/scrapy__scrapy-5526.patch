  "patch": "## Reasoning\n\nBased on the lint report, the issue is with a pylintrc configuration file that contains an invalid pylint rule name `'misplaced-comparison-constant'`. The error message indicates:\n\n```\nUnknown option value for '--disable', expected a valid pylint message and got 'misplaced-comparison-constant'\n```\n\nThis suggests that `'misplaced-comparison-constant'` is not a recognized pylint rule name in the current version of pylint being used. This rule name appears to be either:\n\n1. A deprecated rule that has been removed from newer versions of pylint\n2. A typo or incorrect rule name\n3. A rule that was renamed in newer versions\n\nThe most likely scenario is that this rule name is deprecated or invalid. The standard approach to fix this is to remove the invalid rule name from the pylint configuration.\n\nSince I cannot locate the pylintrc file through the search APIs, but the lint report clearly indicates it exists at `/testbed/pylintrc`, I will create a patch that assumes the file exists and contains the problematic rule name in a typical pylint configuration format.\n\n## Patch\n\n```\n<file>pylintrc</file>\n<original>\ndisable=misplaced-comparison-constant\n</original>\n<patched>\ndisable=\n</patched>\n```"
