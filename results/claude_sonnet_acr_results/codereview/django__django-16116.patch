  "patch": "Looking at the issue, I need to understand what's happening. The problem is that `makemigrations --check` is inconsistent with other Django commands that use `--check`. Specifically:\n\n1. `migrate --check` and `optimizemigration --check` just exit after checking (without performing the actual operation)\n2. `makemigrations --check` currently writes migration files AND then checks, which is inconsistent\n\nThe issue description states that `makemigrations --check` should just exit without making migrations, similar to how other `--check` commands work.\n\nHowever, looking at the provided code locations, none of them seem to be related to the `makemigrations` command. The locations show:\n- `changepassword.py` \n- `createsuperuser.py`\n- `remove_stale_contenttypes.py`\n\nThese are unrelated to the makemigrations command. The intended behavior descriptions mention checking for `check_changes` option and exiting with `sys.exit(1)` if changes are detected, but this seems to be describing the fix needed for the actual `makemigrations` command.\n\nSince the provided locations don't contain the actual `makemigrations` command code, I need to look for where this command would be implemented. Based on Django's structure, this would likely be in `django/core/management/commands/makemigrations.py`.\n\nLet me reason about what the fix should be:\n\n1. The `makemigrations` command should have a `--check` option\n2. When `--check` is used, it should detect if there are pending migrations to be created\n3. If there are pending migrations, it should exit with status code 1 WITHOUT creating the migration files\n4. If there are no pending migrations, it should exit with status code 0\n\nThe intended behavior descriptions suggest that the current implementation writes migration files first and then checks the `check_changes` option at the end, but it should check early and exit before writing any files.\n\nSince I don't have the actual `makemigrations.py` file in the provided locations, I cannot create a specific patch. However, based on the pattern described in the intended behaviors and the issue description, the fix would involve:\n\n1. Moving the check for the `--check` option to occur right after changes are detected\n2. Exiting with `sys.exit(1)` if changes are detected and `--check` is True\n3. Not calling the migration file writing methods when in check mode\n\nWithout the actual `makemigrations.py` code, I cannot provide a specific patch. The provided code locations appear to be incorrect or incomplete for this issue.\n\nHowever, if I had to make an educated guess based on the pattern described, the fix would look something like this in the makemigrations command:\n\n```\n<file>django/core/management/commands/makemigrations.py</file>\n<original>\n# After detecting changes but before writing migration files\nif changes:\n    # Write migration files\n    self.write_migration_files(changes)\n    \n    # Check for --check option at the end\n    if options['check_changes']:\n        sys.exit(1)\n</original>\n<patched>\n# After detecting changes but before writing migration files\nif changes:\n    # Check for --check option early and exit if changes detected\n    if options['check_changes']:\n        sys.exit(1)\n    \n    # Only write migration files if not in check mode\n    self.write_migration_files(changes)\n</patched>\n```\n\nBut since I don't have the actual makemigrations.py file content, I cannot provide the exact patch needed."
