  "patch": "To address the issue of skipping the auth.E003 system check for `USERNAME_FIELD` with total UniqueConstraints, we need to modify the `check_user_model` function in `django/contrib/auth/checks.py`. The goal is to check if there are any unique constraints defined on the `USERNAME_FIELD` in addition to checking for the `unique` parameter on the field. If a unique constraint is found, the function should not raise an auth.E003 error.\n\nThe current implementation only checks if the field named as `USERNAME_FIELD` is unique. However, it does not consider the case where a unique constraint is defined on the field through the model's Meta.constraints.\n\nHere's the step-by-step reasoning:\n\n1. **Identify the relevant code block**: The `check_user_model` function in `django/contrib/auth/checks.py` is responsible for checking the user model. Specifically, we are interested in the part where it checks for the uniqueness of the `USERNAME_FIELD`.\n\n2. **Understand the current behavior**: Currently, it checks if the field is unique by calling `cls._meta.get_field(cls.USERNAME_FIELD).unique`. If the field is not unique, it raises an auth.E003 error.\n\n3. **Determine the necessary change**: We need to modify this check to also consider unique constraints defined in the model's Meta.constraints.\n\n4. **Propose the solution**: We will introduce a new function, `has_unique_constraint`, which checks if a field is covered by a unique constraint. We will then use this function in addition to the existing uniqueness check.\n\nHere is the patch:\n\n```\n<file>django/contrib/auth/checks.py</file>\n<original>\nfrom django.db.models import MethodType\n</original>\n<patched>\nfrom django.db.models import MethodType, Field\nfrom django.db.models.constraints import UniqueConstraint\n\ndef has_unique_constraint(model_meta, field_name):\n    constraints = model_meta.constraints\n    field = model_meta.get_field(field_name)\n    for constraint in constraints:\n        if isinstance(constraint, UniqueConstraint) and field_name in constraint.fields:\n            return True\n    return False\n</patched>\n```\n\n```\n<file>django/contrib/auth/checks.py</file>\n<original\n     if not cls._meta.get_field(cls.USERNAME_FIELD).unique:\n        if (settings.AUTHENTICATION_BACKENDS ==\n                ['django.contrib.auth.backends.ModelBackend']):\n            errors.append(\n                checks.Error(\n                    \"'%s.%s' must be unique because it is named as the 'USERNAME_FIELD'.\" % (\n                        cls._meta.object_name, cls.USERNAME_FIELD\n                    ),\n                    obj=cls,\n                    id='auth.E003',\n                )\n            )\n        else:\n            errors.append(\n                checks.Warning(\n                    \"'%s.%s' is named as the 'USERNAME_FIELD', but it is not unique.\" % (\n                        cls._meta.object_name, cls.USERNAME_FIELD\n                    ),\n                    hint='Ensure that your authentication backend(s) can handle non-unique usernames.',\n                    obj=cls,\n                    id='auth.W004',\n                )\n            )\n</original>\n<patched>\n    if not cls._meta.get_field(cls.USERNAME_FIELD).unique and not has_unique_constraint(cls._meta, cls.USERNAME_FIELD):\n        if (settings.AUTHENTICATION_BACKENDS ==\n                ['django.contrib.auth.backends.ModelBackend']):\n            errors.append(\n                checks.Error(\n                    \"'%s.%s' must be unique because it is named as the 'USERNAME_FIELD'.\" % (\n                        cls._meta.object_name, cls.USERNAME_FIELD\n                    ),\n                    obj=cls,\n                    id='auth.E003',\n                )\n            )\n        else:\n            errors.append(\n                checks.Warning(\n                    \"'%s.%s' is named as the 'USERNAME_FIELD', but it is not unique.\" % (\n                        cls._meta.object_name, cls.USERNAME_FIELD\n                    ),\n                    hint='Ensure that your authentication backend(s) can handle non-unique usernames.',\n                    obj=cls,\n                    id='auth.W004',\n                )\n            )\n</patched>\n```"
