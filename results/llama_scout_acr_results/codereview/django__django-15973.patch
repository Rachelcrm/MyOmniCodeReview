  "patch": "To address the issue of \"AttributeError: 'str' object has no attribute '_meta'\" on migration when defining the \"through\" model in a many-to-many field in another app, we need to modify the `_check_relationship_model` method in `django/db/models/fields/related.py`. \n\nThe error occurs because when the `through` model is specified as a string, it is not properly resolved to the actual model class during the migration process. This results in an `AttributeError` when trying to access the `_meta` attribute of the `through` model, which is a string.\n\nHere's the step-by-step reasoning:\n\n1. **Understanding the Issue**: The problem arises when the `through` argument in a `ManyToManyField` is a string representing the model path. During migration, Django checks the relationship model, and if it's a string, it doesn't have a `_meta` attribute, leading to the error.\n\n2. **Identifying the Solution**: The solution involves resolving the `through` model string to the actual model class before checking its attributes. This can be achieved by using Django's app registry to get the model class from its string representation.\n\n3. **Modifying the `_check_relationship_model` Method**: We need to modify this method to handle the case where `self.remote_field.through` is a string. If it's a string, we should resolve it to the model class using the app registry.\n\nHere is the patch:\n\n```\n<file>django/db/models/fields/related.py</file>\n<original\n        if hasattr(self.remote_field.through, \"_meta\"):\n            qualified_model_name = \"%s.%s\" % (\n                self.remote_field.through._meta.app_label,\n                self.remote_field.through.__name__,\n            )\n        else:\n            qualified_model_name = self.remote_field.through\n\n        errors = []\n\n        if self.remote_field.through not in self.opts.apps.get_models(\n            include_auto_created=True\n        ):\n            # The relationship model is not installed.\n            errors.append(\n                checks.Error(\n                    \"Field specifies a many-to-many relation through model \"\n                    \"'%s', which has not been installed.\" % qualified_model_name,\n                    obj=self,\n                    id=\"fields.E331\",\n                )\n            )\n</original>\n<patched>\n        if isinstance(self.remote_field.through, str):\n            qualified_model_name = self.remote_field.through\n            try:\n                self.remote_field.through = self.opts.apps.get_model(\n                    self.remote_field.through\n                )\n            except LookupError:\n                errors.append(\n                    checks.Error(\n                        \"Field specifies a many-to-many relation through model \"\n                        \"'%s', which has not been installed.\" % qualified_model_name,\n                        obj=self,\n                        id=\"fields.E331\",\n                    )\n                )\n        else:\n            qualified_model_name = \"%s.%s\" % (\n                self.remote_field.through._meta.app_label,\n                self.remote_field.through.__name__,\n            )\n\n        errors = []\n\n        if self.remote_field.through not in self.opts.apps.get_models(\n            include_auto_created=True\n        ):\n            # The relationship model is not installed.\n            errors.append(\n                checks.Error(\n                    \"Field specifies a many-to-many relation through model \"\n                    \"'%s', which has not been installed.\" % qualified_model_name,\n                    obj=self,\n                    id=\"fields.E331\",\n                )\n            )\n</patched>\n```"
