  "patch": "To address the issue where `method_decorator()` should preserve wrapper assignments, including attributes like `__name__`, `__module__`, etc., when applied to a method or function, including those that are partial objects, we need to analyze the provided code context and understand how decorators are applied and how they affect the wrapped functions.\n\nThe problem arises because the function passed to the decorator is a partial object and lacks the attributes expected from a function, such as `__name__`, `__module__`, etc. This issue is specifically noted when using `method_decorator` with a partial object, leading to an `AttributeError` because partial objects do not have a `__name__` attribute.\n\nGiven the context, the solution involves modifying the `method_decorator` function in `django/utils/decorators.py` to properly handle and preserve the attributes of the original function when applying decorators.\n\nHere is the necessary patch:\n\n```\n<file>django/utils/decorators.py</file>\n<original>\n61     def _dec(obj):\n62         if not isinstance(obj, type):\n63             return _multi_decorate(decorator, obj)\n64         if not (name and hasattr(obj, name)):\n65             raise ValueError(\n66                 \"The keyword argument `name` must be the name of a method \"\n67                 \"of the decorated class: %s. Got '%s' instead.\" % (obj, name)\n68             )\n69         method = getattr(obj, name)\n70         if not callable(method):\n71             raise TypeError(\n72                 \"Cannot decorate '%s' as it isn't a callable attribute of \"\n73                 \"%s (%s).\" % (name, obj, method)\n74             )\n75         _wrapper = _multi_decorate(decorator, method)\n76         setattr(obj, name, _wrapper)\n77         return obj\n</original>\n<patched>\n61     def _dec(obj):\n62         if not isinstance(obj, type):\n63             if hasattr(obj, '__name__'):\n                update_wrapper(_dec, obj)\n            return _multi_decorate(decorator, obj)\n        if not (name and hasattr(obj, name)):\n            raise ValueError(\n                \"The keyword argument `name` must be the name of a method \"\n                \"of the decorated class: %s. Got '%s' instead.\" % (obj, name)\n            )\n        method = getattr(obj, name)\n        if not callable(method):\n            raise TypeError(\n                \"Cannot decorate '%s' as it isn't a callable attribute of \"\n                \"%s (%s).\" % (name, obj, method)\n            )\n        _wrapper = _multi_decorate(decorator, method)\n        setattr(obj, name, _wrapper)\n        return obj\n</patched>\n```\n\nHowever, to properly address the issue of preserving wrapper assignments for partial objects, we should focus on ensuring that `update_wrapper` is called appropriately to preserve the metadata of the original function.\n\nAnother potential modification could involve directly updating the wrapper with the original function's metadata if it's available:\n\n```\n<file>django/utils/decorators.py</file>\n<original>\n81     if not hasattr(decorator, '__iter__'):\n82         update_wrapper(_dec, decorator)\n</original>\n<patched>\n81     if not hasattr(decorator, '__iter__'):\n82         if hasattr(decorator, '__name__'):\n            update_wrapper(_dec, decorator)\n        else:\n            update_wrapper(_dec, decorator.__class__)\n</patched>\n```\n\nBut the most accurate and relevant change, considering standard practices for preserving function metadata when using decorators, would involve ensuring that `update_wrapper` is used correctly within the `_multi_decorate` function or directly in `method_decorator` to handle partial objects and other types of callables properly.\n\nGiven the goal of preserving metadata and the specifics of how `method_decorator` and `_multi_decorate` work, we need to ensure that the original function's attributes are correctly transferred to the decorated function. \n\nThe most straightforward and relevant patch, focusing on the critical aspect of preserving metadata for the decorated method, would thus involve adjusting how `method_decorator` handles the updating of wrapper metadata:\n\n```\n<file>django/utils/decorators.py</file>\n<original>\ndef method_decorator(decorator, name=''):\n    \"\"\"\n    Convert a function decorator into a method decorator\n    \"\"\"\n    # 'obj' can be a class or a function.

If 'obj' is a class, the 'name' is required to be the name\n    # of the method that will be decorated.\n    def _dec(obj):\n        if not isinstance(obj, type):\n            return _multi_decorate(decorator, obj)\n        if not (name and hasattr(obj, name)):\n            raise ValueError(\n                \"The keyword argument `name` must"
