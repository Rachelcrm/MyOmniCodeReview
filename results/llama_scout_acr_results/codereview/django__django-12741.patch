  "patch": "To address the issue of simplifying the signature of `DatabaseOperations.execute_sql_flush()`, we need to understand the current implementation and how it can be modified to drop the `using` argument.\n\nThe current signature of `execute_sql_flush` is:\n```python\ndef execute_sql_flush(self, using, sql_list):\n```\nThe goal is to change it to:\n```python\ndef execute_sql_flush(self, sql_list):\n```\nThis change involves removing the `using` parameter from the method signature and inferring it from `self.connection.alias` within the method.\n\nHere's the step-by-step reasoning:\n\n1. **Identify the location of the method**: The method `execute_sql_flush` is located in `django/db/backends/base/operations.py` within the `BaseDatabaseOperations` class.\n\n2. **Understand the purpose of the `using` argument**: The `using` argument is used to specify the database alias for the transaction. However, it can be inferred from `self.connection.alias`, which suggests that the connection to the database is already established and the alias can be directly accessed.\n\n3. **Modify the method signature**: To simplify the signature, we need to remove the `using` argument from the method definition.\n\n4. **Update the method body to use `self.connection.alias`**: Within the method, we need to replace `using` with `self.connection.alias` in the `transaction.atomic` context manager to ensure that the transaction is atomic with respect to the correct database connection.\n\nNow, let's apply these changes:\n\n```\n<file>django/db/backends/base/operations.py</file>\n<original>\n    def execute_sql_flush(self, using, sql_list):\n        \"\"\"Execute a list of SQL statements to flush the database.\"\"\"\n        with transaction.atomic(using=using, savepoint=self.connection.features.can_rollback_ddl):\n            with self.connection.cursor() as cursor:\n                for sql in sql_list:\n                    cursor.execute(sql)\n</original>\n<patched>\n    def execute_sql_flush(self, sql_list):\n        \"\"\"Execute a list of SQL statements to flush the database.\"\"\"\n        with transaction.atomic(using=self.connection.alias, savepoint=self.connection.features.can_rollback_ddl):\n            with self.connection.cursor() as cursor:\n                for sql in sql_list:\n                    cursor.execute(sql)\n</patched>\n```"
