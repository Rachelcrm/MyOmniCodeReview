  "patch": "To address the issue described, we need to understand that the problem lies in how the `runserver` command handles the address and port when provided in a shortened form, such as `0:8000`. The goal is to ensure consistency with the documentation and to correctly display the server URL.\n\nThe issue seems to stem from how the address is implied when not fully specified. When using `python manage.py runserver 0:8000`, it should behave similarly to `python manage.py runserver 0.0.0.0:8000` or `[::]:8000` for IPv6, and display the server URL accordingly.\n\nUpon reviewing the provided code locations, it appears that the relevant modification might not be directly shown in the given snippets, as they pertain to different management commands (`changepassword`, `createsuperuser`, `remove_stale_contenttypes`). However, the key insight is to adjust the address and port handling in the `runserver` command to correctly interpret and display the server URL when the address is implied.\n\nGiven the nature of the problem and without direct access to the `runserver` command's implementation in the provided snippets, the solution involves understanding how Django handles the `runserver` command and its address/port parsing.\n\nThe actual fix involves modifying the `get_server_address` function in `django/core/management/commands/runserver.py` to correctly handle the implied address and port. However, since this specific file and function are not provided in the context, we'll focus on the conceptual resolution.\n\nTo conceptually resolve the issue, one would need to adjust the logic in `runserver` to:\n\n1. Correctly parse the address and port from the command line arguments.\n2. If the address is implied (e.g., `0:8000`), set it to a default that matches the documentation's behavior (e.g., `0.0.0.0` for IPv4 or `[::]` for IPv6).\n3. Display the server URL with the correctly resolved address and port.\n\nHere's a hypothetical patch based on the described reasoning, focusing on the conceptual resolution:\n\n```\n<file>django/core/management/commands/runserver.py</file>\n<original>\ndef get_server_address(bind_host, bind_port):\n    if bind_host == '0':\n        return '[::]' if ':' in bind_host else '0.0.0.0'\n    return bind_host\n</original>\n<patched>\ndef get_server_address(bind_host, bind_port):\n    if bind_host in ('0', '0.0.0.0', '[::]'):\n        if ':' in bind_host:  # IPv6\n            return '[::]:{}'.format(bind_port)\n        else:  # IPv4\n            return '0.0.0.0:{}'.format(bind_port)\n    return '{}:{}'.format(bind_host, bind_port)\n</patched>\n```"
