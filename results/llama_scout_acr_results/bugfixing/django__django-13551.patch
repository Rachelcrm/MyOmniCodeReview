  "patch": "To address the issue of changing a user's email invalidating password reset tokens, we need to modify the `_make_hash_value` method in the `PasswordResetTokenGenerator` class. This method is responsible for generating a hash value that is used to create a password reset token. The hash value is generated based on the user's primary key, password, last login timestamp, and the timestamp of the token. However, it does not currently take into account the user's email address.\n\nThe reasoning behind including the email address in the hash value calculation is that if a user's email address changes, the existing password reset tokens should become invalid. This is because the email address is a critical piece of user information that can be used to identify the user and verify their identity.\n\nHere is the necessary patch:\n\n```\n<file>django/contrib/auth/tokens.py</file>\n<original>\n96         login_timestamp = '' if user.last_login is None else user.last_login.replace(microsecond=0, tzinfo=None)\n97         return str(user.pk) + user.password + str(login_timestamp) + str(timestamp)\n</original>\n<patched>\n96         login_timestamp = '' if user.last_login is None else user.last_login.replace(microsecond=0, tzinfo=None)\n97         email = user.get_email() if hasattr(user, 'get_email') else ''\n98         return str(user.pk) + user.password + str(login_timestamp) + str(email) + str(timestamp)\n</patched>\n```\n\nHowever, a more robust and Django-way of solving this issue would be to use the `getattr` function to safely retrieve the email attribute from the user object, and to make sure that we're not assuming that all users have an email attribute. \n\nA better approach would be:\n\n```\n<file>django/contrib/auth/tokens.py</file>\n<original>\n96         login_timestamp = '' if user.last_login is None else user.last_login.replace(microsecond=0, tzinfo=None)\n97         return str(user.pk) + user.password + str(login_timestamp) + str(timestamp)\n</original>\n<patched>\n96         login_timestamp = '' if user.last_login is None else user.last_login.replace(microsecond=0, tzinfo=None)\n97         email = getattr(user, 'email', '')\n98         return str(user.pk) + user.password + str(login_timestamp) + str(email) + str(timestamp)\n</patched>\n```"
