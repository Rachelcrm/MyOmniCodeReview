  "patch": "To address the Pylint feedback and resolve the issue, we need to ensure that the `admin_site` attribute is properly checked before accessing its attributes. The warnings and errors indicate that there are instances where `self.admin_site` is being used without being checked for `None`, which could lead to potential errors.\n\nThe necessary changes involve adding checks to ensure that `self.admin_site` is not `None` before attempting to access its attributes. This is particularly relevant in methods like `formfield_for_dbfield`, `get_field_queryset`, `formfield_for_foreignkey`, and `formfield_for_manytomany`.\n\nHere's how we can modify the code:\n\n```\n<file>django/contrib/admin/options.py</file>\n<original>\n    def formfield_for_dbfield(self, db_field, request, **kwargs):\n        \"\"\"\n        Hook for specifying the form Field instance for a given database Field\n        instance.\n        \n        If kwargs are given, they're passed to the form Field's constructor.\n        \"\"\"\n        # If the field specifies choices, we don't need to look for special\n        # admin widgets - we just need to use a select widget of some kind.\n        if db_field.choices:\n            return self.formfield_for_choice_field(db_field, request, **kwargs)\n        \n        # ForeignKey or ManyToManyFields\n        if isinstance(db_field, (models.ForeignKey, models.ManyToManyField)):\n            # Combine the field kwargs with any options for formfield_overrides.\n            # Make sure the passed in **kwargs override anything in\n            # formfield_overrides because **kwargs is more specific, and should\n            # always win.\n            if db_field.__class__ in self.formfield_overrides:\n                kwargs = {**self.formfield_overrides[db_field.__class__], **kwargs}\n            \n            # Get the correct formfield.\n            if isinstance(db_field, models.ForeignKey):\n                formfield = self.formfield_for_foreignkey(db_field, request, **kwargs)\n            elif isinstance(db_field, models.ManyToManyField):\n                formfield = self.formfield_for_manytomany(db_field, request, **kwargs)\n            \n            # For non-raw_id fields, wrap the widget with a wrapper that adds\n            # extra HTML -- the \"add other\" interface -- to the end of the\n            # rendered output. formfield can be None if it came from a\n            # OneToOneField with parent_link=True or a M2M intermediary.\n            if formfield and db_field.name not in self.raw_id_fields:\n                related_modeladmin = self.admin_site._registry.get(db_field.remote_field.model)\n                if related_modeladmin is not None:\n                    wrapper_kwargs = {}\n                    wrapper_kwargs.update(\n                        can_add_related=related_modeladmin.has_add_permission(request),\n                        can_change_related=related_modeladmin.has_change_permission(request),\n                        can_delete_related=related_modeladmin.has_delete_permission(request),\n                        can_view_related=related_modeladmin.has_view_permission(request),\n                    )\n                    formfield.widget = widgets.RelatedFieldWidgetWrapper(\n                        formfield.widget, db_field.remote_field, self.admin_site, **wrapper_kwargs\n                    )\n            return formfield\n</original>\n<patched>\n    def formfield_for_dbfield(self, db_field, request, **kwargs):\n        \"\"\"\n        Hook for specifying the form Field instance for a given database Field\n        instance.\n        \n        If kwargs are given, they're passed to the form Field's constructor.\n        \"\"\"\n        # If the field specifies choices, we don't need to look for special\n        # admin widgets - we just need to use a select widget of some kind.\n        if db_field.choices:\n            return self.formfield_for_choice_field(db_field, request, **kwargs)\n        \n        # ForeignKey or ManyToManyFields\n        if isinstance(db_field, (models.ForeignKey, models.ManyToManyField)):\n            # Combine the field kwargs with any options for formfield_overrides.\n            # Make sure the passed in **kwargs override anything in\n            # formfield_overrides because **kwargs is more specific, and should\n            # always win.\n            if db_field.__class__ in self.formfield_overrides:\n                kwargs = {**self.formfield_overrides[db_field.__class__], **kwargs}\n            \n            # Get the correct formfield.\n            if isinstance(db_field, models.ForeignKey):\n                formfield = self.formfield_for_foreignkey(db_field, request, **kwargs)\n            elif isinstance(db_field, models.ManyToManyField):\n                formfield = self.formfield_for_manytomany(db_field, request, **kwargs)\n            \n            # For non-raw_id fields, wrap the widget with a wrapper that adds\n            # extra HTML -- the \"add other\" interface -- to the end of the\n            # rendered output. formfield can be None if it came from a\n            # OneToOneField with parent_link=True or a M2M intermediary.\n            if formfield and db_field"
