  "patch": "To address the Pylint feedback and resolve the issue, we need to make several modifications to the `django/utils/http.py` file. \n\nThe first issue is with the `parse_http_date` function where the variable `min` is shadowing the built-in `min` function. We should rename `min` to `minute` to avoid this conflict.\n\nThe second issue is in the same `parse_http_date` function where a general `Exception` is being caught. It would be better to catch specific exceptions that can occur during the execution of the function, such as `ValueError`.\n\nThe third issue is with the `parse_http_date_safe` function where a general `Exception` is being caught. Similar to the previous point, it would be better to catch specific exceptions.\n\nThe fourth issue is with the `urlsafe_base64_decode` function where the `raise...from` syntax can be used to chain the original exception.\n\nHere are the necessary modifications:\n\n```\n<file>django/utils/http.py</file>\n<original>\n186         min = int(m.group('min'))\n187         sec = int(m.group('sec'))\n188         result = datetime.datetime(year, month, day, hour, min, sec)\n</original>\n<patched>\n186         minute = int(m.group('min'))\n187         sec = int(m.group('sec'))\n188         result = datetime.datetime(year, month, day, hour, minute, sec)\n</patched>\n```\n\n```\n<file>django/utils/http.py</file>\n<original>\n190     except Exception as exc:\n191         raise ValueError(\"%r is not a valid date\" % date) from exc\n</original>\n<patched>\n190     except (ValueError, OverflowError) as exc:\n191         raise ValueError(\"%r is not a valid date\" % date) from exc\n</patched>\n```\n\n```\n<file>django/utils/http.py</file>\n<original>\n200     except Exception:\n201         pass\n</original>\n<patched>\n200     except (ValueError, OverflowError):\n201         pass\n</patched>\n```\n\n```\n<file>django/utils/http.py</file>\n<original>\n250         raise ValueError(e)\n</original>\n<patched>\n250         raise ValueError(e) from e\n</patched>\n```"
