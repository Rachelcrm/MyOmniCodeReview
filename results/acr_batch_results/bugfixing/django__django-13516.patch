  "patch": "To address the issue of `flush()` not working as expected on `self.stdout` and `self.stderr` in management commands, we need to understand the underlying cause. The problem lies in the `OutputWrapper` class, which is a wrapper around `stdout` and `stderr`. This class does not currently implement a `flush` method, which is necessary for ensuring that output is immediately written to the underlying stream, rather than being buffered.\n\nThe `OutputWrapper` class is defined in `django/core/management/base.py`. To fix the issue, we need to add a `flush` method to this class that calls the `flush` method on the underlying output stream (`self._out`).\n\nHere's the step-by-step reasoning:\n1. Identify the `OutputWrapper` class in `django/core/management/base.py`.\n2. Recognize that this class wraps around `stdout` and `stderr` but does not implement a `flush` method.\n3. Understand that the `flush` method is necessary to ensure that buffered output is written to the underlying stream immediately.\n\nGiven this understanding, the solution involves modifying the `OutputWrapper` class to include a `flush` method.\n\n```\n<file>django/core/management/base.py</file>\n<original>\n140     def __getattr__(self, name):\n141         return getattr(self._out, name)\n142 \n143     def isatty(self):\n144         return hasattr(self._out, 'isatty') and self._out.isatty()\n145 \n146     def write(self, msg='', style_func=None, ending=None):\n147         ending = self.ending if ending is None else ending\n148         if ending and not msg.endswith(ending):\n149             msg += ending\n150         style_func = style_func or self.style_func\n151         self._out.write(style_func(msg))\n</original>\n<patched>\n140     def __getattr__(self, name):\n141         return getattr(self._out, name)\n142 \n143     def isatty(self):\n144         return hasattr(self._out, 'isatty') and self._out.isatty()\n145 \n146     def write(self, msg='', style_func=None, ending=None):\n147         ending = self.ending if ending is None else ending\n148         if ending and not msg.endswith(ending):\n149             msg += ending\n150         style_func = style_func or self.style_func\n151         self._out.write(style_func(msg))\n152 \n153     def flush(self):\n154         self._out.flush()\n</patched>\n```\n\nThis modification adds a `flush` method to the `OutputWrapper` class, which calls the `flush` method on the underlying output stream (`self._out`). This ensures that when `flush` is called on an instance of `OutputWrapper` (such as `self.stdout` or `self.stderr` in a management command), it will properly flush the output buffer, resolving the issue described."
