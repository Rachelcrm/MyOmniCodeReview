  "patch": "To address the issue of `flush()` not working on `self.stdout/stderr` management commands, we need to understand the root cause of the problem. The issue arises because the `OutputWrapper` class, which wraps around `stdout/stderr`, does not have a `flush` method. This method is essential for ensuring that output is displayed immediately, rather than being buffered.\n\nThe `OutputWrapper` class is defined in `django/core/management/base.py`. Upon examining this class, it's clear that it delegates many of its methods to the underlying output stream (`self._out`). However, it lacks a `flush` method, which is necessary for flushing the output buffer.\n\nTo fix this issue, we need to add a `flush` method to the `OutputWrapper` class. This method should simply call the `flush` method on the underlying output stream (`self._out`).\n\nHere's the necessary patch:\n\n```\n<file>django/core/management/base.py</file>\n<original>\n140     def __getattr__(self, name):\n141         return getattr(self._out, name)\n142 \n143     def isatty(self):\n144         return hasattr(self._out, 'isatty') and self._out.isatty()\n145 \n146     def write(self, msg='', style_func=None, ending=None):\n147         ending = self.ending if ending is None else ending\n148         if ending and not msg.endswith(ending):\n149             msg += ending\n150         style_func = style_func or self.style_func\n151         self._out.write(style_func(msg))\n</original>\n<patched>\n140     def __getattr__(self, name):\n141         return getattr(self._out, name)\n142 \n143     def isatty(self):\n144         return hasattr(self._out, 'isatty') and self._out.isatty()\n145 \n146     def flush(self):\n147         self._out.flush()\n148 \n149     def write(self, msg='', style_func=None, ending=None):\n150         ending = self.ending if ending is None else ending\n151         if ending and not msg.endswith(ending):\n152             msg += ending\n153         style_func = style_func or self.style_func\n154         self._out.write(style_func(msg))\n</patched>\n```\n\nThis patch adds the `flush` method to the `OutputWrapper` class, ensuring that output is displayed immediately when `flush()` is called on `self.stdout` or `self.stderr` in management commands."
