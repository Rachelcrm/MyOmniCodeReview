  "patch": "To solve this task, let's analyze the given issue and the provided code context. The issue is related to the `Quaternion.to_rotation_matrix()` method, which is supposed to return the equivalent rotation transformation matrix of the quaternion. The problem arises when the method is called with a specific quaternion, and the resulting rotation matrix has an incorrect sign.\n\nThe given code context includes the implementation of the `Quaternion` class, which provides basic quaternion operations. The `to_rotation_matrix` method is of particular interest, as it is the source of the issue.\n\nUpon examining the `to_rotation_matrix` method, we notice that the calculation of the rotation matrix elements involves the quaternion's components (`q.a`, `q.b`, `q.c`, `q.d`) and the inverse of the quaternion's norm squared (`s = q.norm()**-2`). The method returns a 3x3 rotation matrix if no point is provided, or a 4x4 transformation matrix if a point is passed as an argument.\n\nThe issue seems to be related to the signs of the terms in the rotation matrix. Specifically, the example provided in the issue description shows that one of the `sin(x)` functions should be negative.\n\nLet's focus on the relevant part of the code:\n```python\nm10 = 2*s*(q.b*q.c + q.d*q.a)\nm21 = 2*s*(q.c*q.d + q.b*q.a)\n```\n\nTo fix the issue, we need to adjust the signs of the terms in the rotation matrix. Based on the quaternion rotation formula, the correct calculation for `m10` and `m21` should be:\n```python\nm10 = 2*s*(q.b*q.c - q.d*q.a)\nm21 = 2*s*(q.c*q.d - q.b*q.a)\n```\n\nHere is the patch:\n```\n<file>sympy/algebras/quaternion.py</file>\n<original>\n530         m10 = 2*s*(q.b*q.c + q.d*q.a)\n531         m11 = 1 - 2*s*(q.b**2 + q.d**2)\n532         m12 = 2*s*(q.c*q.d + q.b*q.a)\n533 \n534         m20 = 2*s*(q.b*q.d - q.c*q.a)\n535         m21 = 2*s*(q.c*q.d + q.b*q.a)\n536         m22 = 1 - 2*s*(q.b**2 + q.c**2)\n</original>\n</patched>\n<patched>\n530         m10 = 2*s*(q.b*q.c - q.d*q.a)\n531         m11 = 1 - 2*s*(q.b**2 + q.d**2)\n532         m12 = 2*s*(q.c*q.d + q.b*q.a)\n533 \n534         m20 = 2*s*(q.b*q.d - q.c*q.a)\n535         m21 = 2*s*(q.c*q.d - q.b*q.a)\n536         m22 = 1 - 2*s*(q.b**2 + q.c**2)\n</patched>\n```"
