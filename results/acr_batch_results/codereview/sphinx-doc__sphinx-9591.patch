  "patch": "To address the issue of cross-references not working in property's type annotations, we need to analyze the provided code context and identify the necessary modifications.\n\nThe issue seems to be related to how the `handle_signature` method in the `PyProperty` class handles type annotations. Specifically, it appears that the method is not properly resolving cross-references in type annotations.\n\nUpon examining the code, we can see that the `handle_signature` method is responsible for adding a type annotation to the signature node. However, it simply adds the type annotation as a string without resolving any cross-references.\n\nTo fix this issue, we need to modify the `handle_signature` method to properly resolve cross-references in type annotations. We can do this by using the `resolve_type` method provided by the `PythonDomain` class.\n\nHere is the necessary patch:\n\n```\n<file>sphinx/domains/python.py</file>\n<original>\n862         typ = self.options.get('type')\n863         if typ:\n864             signode += addnodes.desc_annotation(typ, ': ' + typ)\n865 \n</original>\n<patched>\n862         typ = self.options.get('type')\n863         if typ:\n864             signode += addnodes.desc_annotation(self.env.domains['python'].resolve_type(typ, self.env), ': ' + typ)\n865 \n</patched>\n```\n\nThis patch modifies the `handle_signature` method to use the `resolve_type` method to resolve cross-references in type annotations. This should fix the issue and allow cross-references to work properly in property's type annotations."
