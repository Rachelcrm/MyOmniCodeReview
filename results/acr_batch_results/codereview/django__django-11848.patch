  "patch": "To address the issue with `django.utils.http.parse_http_date` and its handling of two-digit years, we need to adjust the logic to comply with the relevant RFCs, specifically RFC 7231 and RFC 2822. These standards suggest that for dates in the RFC 850 format, which uses a two-digit year, the interpretation should be based on the current year. Specifically, a two-digit year that appears to be more than 50 years in the future should be interpreted as representing the most recent year in the past that had the same last two digits.\n\nThe current implementation hardcodes the years 0-69 to be in the range 2000-2069 and 70-99 to be in 1970-1999. However, this approach does not account for the current year and does not correctly implement the requirement to consider a timestamp that appears to be more than 50 years in the future as representing the most recent year in the past.\n\nHere's the step-by-step reasoning:\n\n1. **Identify the Current Logic**: The current logic for handling two-digit years in `parse_http_date` is as follows:\n   - If the year is less than 100, it checks if the year is less than 70. If so, it adds 2000 to the year; otherwise, it adds 1900.\n\n2. **Understand the Requirement**: The requirement is to interpret two-digit years based on the current year, considering a year to be in the past if it appears to be more than 50 years in the future.\n\n3. **Propose a Solution**: To fix this, we need to calculate the current year and then apply the logic based on the current year. We will use the `datetime` module to get the current year.\n\nNow, let's write the patch:\n\n```\n<file>django/utils/http.py</file>\n<original>\nfrom __future__ import unicode_literals\n</original>\n<patched>\nfrom __future__ import unicode_literals\nimport datetime\n</patched>\n```\n\n```\n<file>django/utils/http.py</file>\n<original>\n176     try:\n177         year = int(m.group('year'))\n178         if year < 100:\n179             if year < 70:\n180                 year += 2000\n181             else:\n182                 year += 1900\n183         month = MONTHS.index(m.group('mon').lower()) + 1\n184         day = int(m.group('day'))\n185         hour = int(m.group('hour'))\n186         min = int(m.group('min'))\n187         sec = int(m.group('sec'))\n188         result = datetime.datetime(year, month, day, hour, min, sec)\n189         return calendar.timegm(result.utctimetuple())\n</original>\n<patched>\n176     try:\n177         year = int(m.group('year'))\n178         if year < 100:\n179             current_year = datetime.datetime.now().year\n180             year_50y_ago = current_year - 50\n181             if year > (year_50y_ago % 100):\n182                 year += 1900\n183             else:\n184                 year += 2000\n185         month = MONTHS.index(m.group('mon').lower()) + 1\n186         day = int(m.group('day'))\n187         hour = int(m.group('hour'))\n188         min = int(m.group('min'))\n189         sec = int(m.group('sec'))\n190         result = datetime.datetime(year, month, day, hour, min, sec)\n191         return calendar.timegm(result.utctimetuple())\n</patched>\n```"
