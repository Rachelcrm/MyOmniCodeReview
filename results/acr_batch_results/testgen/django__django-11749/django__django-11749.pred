  "response": "To address the issue described, we need to focus on the `call_command` function in `django/core/management/__init__.py` and ensure it correctly handles required mutually exclusive groups when executing management commands.\n\nHere's how we can approach writing tests for this functionality:\n\n```\n<file>tests/test_management_commands.py</file>\n<original>\n# Empty if creating new file\n</original>\n<patched>\nimport pytest\nfrom django.core.management import call_command\nfrom django.core.management.base import CommandError\n\ndef test_call_command_mutually_exclusive_group():\n    # Arrange\n    # Assuming a command named 'test_command' with a required mutually exclusive group\n    # defined using add_mutually_exclusive_group\n\n    # Act and Assert\n    with pytest.raises(CommandError):\n        call_command('test_command', shop_id=1)\n\n    # Additional assertions or tests for different scenarios\n    # ...\n\ndef test_call_command_mutually_exclusive_group_with_arg():\n    # Test with an argument that is part of a mutually exclusive group\n    call_command('test_command', '--shop-id=1')\n\ndef test_call_command_mutually_exclusive_group_both_args():\n    # Test that passing both args raises an error\n    with pytest.raises(CommandError):\n        call_command('test_command', shop_id=1, '--shop=some_shop')\n\n</patched>\n```\n\nAnd to ensure that the fix does not break existing functionality:\n\n```\n<file>tests/test_management_commands.py</file>\n<original>\n# Empty if creating new file\n</original>\n<patched>\nimport pytest\nfrom django.core.management import call_command\n\ndef test_call_command_simple():\n    # Test a simple command without mutually exclusive groups\n    call_command('simple_command')\n\ndef test_call_command_with_required_arg():\n    # Test a command with a required argument\n    call_command('command_with_required_arg', required_arg='some_value')\n\n</patched>\n```\n\nThese tests cover basic scenarios and edge cases related to the handling of required mutually exclusive groups by the `call_command` function. \n\nPlease adjust the test code according to the actual implementation and requirements of your management commands. \n\nThe goal is to ensure that the `call_command` function behaves as expected in various scenarios, including when dealing with required mutually exclusive groups. \n\nBy writing comprehensive tests, we can verify that the fix works correctly and does not introduce any regressions.",
