  "response": "To address the issue where `solveset` raises a `NotImplementedError` instead of returning a `ConditionSet` for the equation `Eq(n*cos(n) - 3*sin(n), 0).as_set()`, we need to create comprehensive tests that cover this scenario.\n\nThe tests should be placed in an appropriate test file within the existing test suite. Given the functionality related to `solveset` and `ConditionSet`, a suitable location could be `tests/solvers/test_solveset.py`.\n\nHere's how we can structure the test modifications:\n\n```\n<file>tests/solvers/test_solveset.py</file>\n<original>\n# Original content of test_solveset.py\n</original>\n<patched>\n# Import necessary modules\nimport pytest\nfrom sympy import Eq, cos, sin, solveset, ConditionSet, Reals\n\n# Test function to check solveset behavior for Eq(n*cos(n) - 3*sin(n), 0)\ndef test_solveset_trig_eq():\n    n = pytest.symbols('n')\n    equation = Eq(n*cos(n) - 3*sin(n), 0)\n    result = solveset(equation, n, Reals)\n    # Assert that the result is a ConditionSet\n    assert isinstance(result, ConditionSet)\n    # Optionally, verify the condition within the ConditionSet\n    assert result.condition == Eq(n*cos(n) - 3*sin(n), 0)\n\n# Additional test for edge cases or other related scenarios\ndef test_solveset_trig_eq_edge_case():\n    x = pytest.symbols('x')\n    equation = Eq(cos(x), 0)\n    result = solveset(equation, x, Reals)\n    # Verify the result for a known trigonometric equation\n    assert result.is_Union\n\n</patched>\n```\n\nThis modification introduces two test functions:\n- `test_solveset_trig_eq`: Verifies that `solveset` returns a `ConditionSet` for the given trigonometric equation.\n- `test_solveset_trig_eq_edge_case`: Tests `solveset` with another trigonometric equation to ensure it handles edge cases correctly.\n\nThese tests are designed to be self-contained and can be run independently to verify the functionality of `solveset` in conjunction with `ConditionSet`. \n\nPlease adjust the file path and test logic as necessary to fit the existing test suite structure and requirements. \n\nNo further modifications are needed at this point. The provided test suite should comprehensively cover the described issue.",
