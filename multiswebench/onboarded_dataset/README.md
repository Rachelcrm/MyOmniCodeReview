# Newly Onboarded Instances
Due to the large size of each dataset, the newly onboarded Java datasets for MSWEBugFixing are zipped and provided here. 

### To use these datasets: 
1. Unzip the file(s)
2. Move the *_dataset.jsonl file(s) to the multiswebench/mswebench_dataset under its language directory
3. Verify that prepare_eval.py correctly prepares the onboarded instances
