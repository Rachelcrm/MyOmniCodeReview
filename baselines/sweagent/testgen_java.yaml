      I've uploaded a java code repository in the directory {{working_dir}}. Consider the following problem description:

      <problem_description>
      {{problem_statement}}
      </problem_description>

      Can you help me implement a test that successfully reproduces the problem specified in the <problem_description>?
      The test can be created in the repository's existing test suite or as an independent test if more suitable.
      Do not make any changes to the non-test code in the repository since we only need to create a reproduction test.
      Follow these steps to resolve the issue:
      1. As a first step, it might be a good idea to find and read code relevant to the <problem_description>
      2. Create a test to reproduce the error and execute it to confirm the error
      3. Edit the the testing suite of the repo to implement a test for the problem described
      4. Ensure this test runs and successfully reproduces the problem!
      Your thinking should be thorough and so it's fine if it's very long.
