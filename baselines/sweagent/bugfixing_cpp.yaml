      <uploaded_files>
      {{working_dir}}
      </uploaded_files>
      I've uploaded a C++ code repository in the directory {{working_dir}}. Consider the following PR description:

      <pr_description>
      {{problem_statement}}
      </pr_description>

      Can you help me implement the necessary changes to the repository so that the requirements specified in the <pr_description> are met?
      I've already taken care of all changes to any of the test files described in the <pr_description>. This means you DON'T have to modify the testing logic or any of the tests in any way!
      Your task is to make the minimal changes to non-tests files in the {{working_dir}} directory to ensure the <pr_description> is satisfied.
      Follow these steps to resolve the issue:
      1. As a first step, it might be a good idea to find and read code relevant to the <pr_description>
      2. Create a script (e.g., `reproduce.sh`) to compile and run the relevant program or test binary to confirm the issue
         For example, you might use `g++ -std=c++17 -o reproduce main.cpp` and then run `./reproduce`
      3. Edit the source code of the repo to resolve the issue
      4. Rerun your reproduce script and confirm that the issue is fixed!
      5. Think about edge cases and make sure your fix handles them as well
      Your thinking should be thorough and so it's fine if it's very long.

          Thank you for your work on this issue. Please carefully follow the steps below to help review your changes.

          1. If you made any changes to your code after running the reproduction script, please run the reproduction script again.
             If the reproduction script fails to compile or run, please revisit your changes and make sure they are correct.
             If you have already removed your reproduction script, please ignore this step.
          2. Remove your reproduction script (if you haven't done so already).
          3. If you have modified any TEST files (e.g., files under `tests/` or files ending with `_test.cpp`), please revert them to the state they had before you started fixing the issue.
             You can do this with `git checkout -- /path/to/test/file.cpp`. Use the <diff> below to find the files you need to revert.
          4. Run the submit command again to confirm.

          Here is a list of all of your changes:
