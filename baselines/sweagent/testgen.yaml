      I've uploaded a python code repository in the directory {{working_dir}}. Consider the following problem description:

      <problem_description>
      {{problem_statement}}
      </problem_description>

      Can you help me implement a test that successfully reproduces the problem specified in the <problem_description>?
      The test must be created in the repository's existing test suite and should be runable with the repository's testing infrastructure / tooling (e.g. pytest).
      Do not make any changes to the non-test code in the repository since we only need to create a reproduction test.
      Follow these steps to resolve the issue:
      1. As a first step, it might be a good idea to find and read code relevant to the <problem_description>
      2. Create a script to reproduce the error and execute it with `python <filename.py>` using the bash tool, to confirm the error
      3. Edit the the testing suite of the repo to implement a test based on this reproduction script which can be run using the repository's testing infrastructure / tooling (e.g. pytest)
      4. Ensure this test runs and successfully reproduces the problem!
      5. Remove the reproduction script and only keep changes to the test suite that reproduce the problem.
      Your thinking should be thorough and so it's fine if it's very long.

          Thank you for your work on this issue. Please carefully follow the steps below to help review your changes.

          1. Make sure that the test you have implemented runs and successfully using the repository's testing infrastructure / tooling and reproduces the problem specified
          2. If you have modified any NON-TEST files, please revert them to the state they had before you started fixing the issue.
            You can do this with `git checkout -- /path/to/file.py`. Use below <diff> to find the files you need to revert.
          3. Make sure to remove any extraneous standalone reproduction scripts that you may have implemented. Only keep changes to the test suite.
          4. Run the submit command again to confirm.

          Here is a list of all of your changes:
